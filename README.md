Forecasting Property and Land Values by Region/Suburb

üîç Use Case: Forecasting Property and Land Values by Region/Suburb
This model would predict future land or property values based on historical sales, zoning, market trends, and macroeconomic indicators.

‚úÖ Model Objective
Forecast median land values per suburb or property segment (e.g., residential, commercial) on a quarterly or yearly basis.

üìä Input Features
Historical time series of:

Median land values per suburb/postcode

Number of transactions

Property type distributions

Value per square metre

Static features:

Zoning codes (e.g., R2, B4)

Socioeconomic indices (SEIFA)

Distance to CBD / public transport

School zones, amenities

External time series:

Interest rates

CPI / inflation

Construction activity

Unemployment rate

Government infrastructure projects

ü§ñ Recommended Time Series Models
Here are 3 viable options depending on your data richness and explainability needs:

1. Facebook Prophet
Ideal for: interpretable forecasts with seasonality and policy shifts (e.g. rate changes).

Strengths: Handles missing data, changepoints, public holidays.

Implementation: Add regressors for zoning changes, interest rates, etc.

2. XGBoost/LightGBM with Lag Features
Ideal for: tabular property data where you create lag, rolling, and date-based features.

Strengths: High accuracy, works well with heterogeneous data.

Example: Include lag_1y_value, rolling_avg_3y, and suburb_growth_rate.

3. Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) or DeepAR (AWS)
Ideal for: complex multi-series forecasting (many suburbs at once).

Strengths: Handles hierarchical data and uncertainty.

Note: Requires deep learning infra; best used if you forecast hundreds of series.

üß† Advanced Add-ons
Clustering suburbs before modeling: Use K-Means on static features to reduce dimensionality and forecast similar areas together.

Spatial features: Use GIS data or geohashes to incorporate neighbouring suburb effects.

Scenario simulation: Use the model to simulate value impacts due to interest rate shifts or rezoning.
